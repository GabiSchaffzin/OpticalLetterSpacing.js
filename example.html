    <header>cheltenham bold</header>
    
    <article>
      <p>In its century old existence, cheltenham has endured eras of great popularity, as well as times when it was rejected as “dated” or “plain-Jane” by designers. Originally conceived as a book face, Cheltenham’s most famous place in history sits on page a1 of the New York Times, as the newspaper chose the typeface (in various weights and forms) for its headlines.
      <p>Cheltenham was originally commissioned in 1896 by Boston’s Merrymount Press for use in a church altar book. Merrymount’s Daniel Berkeley Updike hired Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, an architect by trade, to design a book-face whose legibility was the primary focus. As Goodhue worked on this old-style face, he attempted to rid the need for leading by lengthening ascenders and shortening descenders. This lack of leading would provide an economical benefit.</p>
      <p>The typeface was released by American Type Founders Company (as well as Mergenthaler Linotype) and enjoyed great success as its straightforward features, stronger uppercase set, and large number of variants made it popular among designers for display purposes. Ever under constant critique, even Updike himself noted that “Its capitals are better than its lowercase, which is too ‘perpendicular’ in effect — a fault appropriate to so distinguished an architect of Gothic buildings! It is, however, an exceedingly handsome letter for ephemeral printing.”</p>
      <p>The typeface was updated in 1970 by itc, who commissioned Tony Stan to even out Goodhue’s original design and reduce its “top-heavy” qualities. In 2003, The New York Times — who had been using “Chelt” as part of its relatively large range of headline typefaces — asked Matthew Carter to design a Times-specific version of the face, called Times Cheltenham, which they still use for their headlines. When perusing The Gray Lady’s titling, take note of the extended apex of the A and ever-so-slight spur extending off the G.</p>

    <header>albertus mt</header>
  
    <p>Inspired by his work with bronze chiseling, Berthold Wolpe designed Albertus between the years of 1932 and 19407. The typeface was requested by Stanley Morison, himself a British type designer (though one equally famous for his work with typographers as his design of typefaces themselves; Morison designed the Microsoft Office mainstay Times New Roman in 1932). Wolpe was trained as a calligrapher and metal worker in Germany, though he eventually moved to England and, as war broke out on the Continent, never returned to his home country.</p>
    <p>In designing Albertus — named after medieval scientist and philosopher, Albert the Great — Wolpe gave his letters a slightly seriffed look by simply widening the stems at certain points, further emphasizing the feel of chiseled characters (also known as “glyphic style”). According to itc, “Wolpe said his chiseling technique made for bold simplicity and reduced the serifs to a bare minimum.” This classifies the typeface somewhere between classical, old style faces based off of calligraphic handwriting, and more modern sans-serif faces. Of particular note are the odd spur of the uppercase G and faux-caligraphic arms of the uppercase E.</p>
    <p>The typeface, commissioned by Monotype, was originally only available as a titling font, with the lowercase characters being added in 1940. Still primarily used for headlines, titles, and commercial packaging, in 1988 the City of London adopted Wolpe’s Albertus in all of its official city sign system. This included street names, city sections (for example, wc1, wc2, et al.), and other city landmarks13.</p>

    <header>futura condensed light</header>
  
    <p>Considered the first “geometric” typeface, Futura was inspired by the efficient and clean designs of the Bauhaus in the late 1920’s. While not a member of the school itself, Paul Renner sought to produce a face that featured even strokes and sparse figures to the mechanized and modern world that was appearing around him15. A painter, graphic designer, and teacher, Renner’s primary claim to fame is this sans-serif typeface.</p>
    <p>Futura was commissioned by the Bauer type foundry in 1927 after Renner worked on its design between 1924 and 1926. During this time he experimented with many alternatives to the traditional letterforms seen in type both at the time and today. While the extended alphabets never gained popularity (though they are currently available in the Architype Renner typeface from The Foundry), the original set of Futura characters became a mainstay in type design, aided by their readability, even in long-form text. This is made possible by the typeface’s “graceful and humane” proportions, “close to those of Centaur in the vertical dimension.”</p>
    <p>The full Futura family of typefaces was released over a number of years, though there have been many derivative and imitative versions developed since. Brands from ikea to nasa, from Absolut Vodka to Domino’s Pizza have adopted Futura at one point or another for their corporate identity. The face is easily identifiable in both upper-case (via the low cross-bars, pointy apexes, and slightly sub-baseline vertexes) and lower-case (via the one story a and perfectly straight stems on the q and j).</p>
